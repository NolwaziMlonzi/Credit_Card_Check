## Introduction

> This Application allows users to submit a bunch of credit card  including country that it is from and card
numbers for validation.
It also checks the specified country to make sure it doesnâ€™t exist in a list of banned countries and ensure the list is configurable.

>It also stores valid cards for the session and display all credit cards that have been captured during the session whilist ensuring the same card number is not captured twice.
